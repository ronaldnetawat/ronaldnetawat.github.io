                    <p>Hi, <br> <br> 
                        I am Ron. I am a junior at <a href="https://owu.edu" target="_blank">Ohio Wesleyan University</a>, majoring in physics and mathematics, and minoring in philosophy and computer science. Welcome to my personal website where I post my thoughts, in the form of articles and blogs, about concepts that I find intriguing, inspiring, and illuminating. <br> <br>
                        
                        I love reading. My favourite authors include Fyodor Dostoevsky, David Deutsch, Ren√© Descartes, Douglas Hofstadter and more. I do programming quests on the side. I am interested in epistemology, philosophy of science, and quantum computation.<br> <br>
                        
                        I am currently working on a senior research project involving <em>The Behavior and Applications of a Josephson Junction based Flux Qubit</em>. As for my career, I aspire to work at the intersection of quantum physics and computers - quantum computation - and artificial intelligence. I am curious about the concept of intelligence and consciousness. <br> <br>

                        My hobbies include listening to music (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1DKgl9ogM5fxgkBgPi2MHH?si=361279628ad34501", target="_blank">my Spotify playlist</a>), writing short stories and movie screenplays, playing the guitar, watching movies and theater, working out, and programming.
