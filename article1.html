                <h2>Little Fires Everywhere</h2>
                <hr> <br>
                <p>There are little fires everywhere, one in me, one in you, there's one in everyone. Crying for help, they are submerged inside your hearts. These little fires are trapped, deep inside our souls. Without any parenting, these fires are lost, lost in our very own selves by our very own selves. But these fires are not dead, neither will they ever, for they are immortal, living inside you as forever, as long as it takes you to find them. Meshed inside you, they are terrified. Seeking help, they are now defenceless, yet they survive. <br> <br>
                These fires, are locked inside your hearts, and the keys to them lie with the people that surround you, your fears and apprehensions. Though they will be diminished to become a single spark, but they will wait, they will wait until the day you come with the keys and open the doors, and you ignite these sparks, and these tiny fierce sparks will light up, and cover the entire world with their light. <br> <br>
                Find your fire, and let it burn you. For it may seem to melt you down at the genesis, but it will make you stronger, it will set you hard, and grow your wings, and teach you to fly.
