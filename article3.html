                <h2>The World Needs to be Understood the Right Way</h2>
                <hr> <br>
                <p>Hey there, this is Ron. I'm a science and liberal education enthusiast. From the last couple of years, I've been looking at the way this magnificent world in which we live, functions. this world is great and beautiful in each and every way and aspect. From tiny living creatures in our bodies to the large and tremendous marvels out there in our space. What bugs me is that many, not many, but too many of us fail to understand and comprehend the beauty and magic of our world. Simply because they do not care. Why? They don't have time, is what most of them will say out there. And this stands out to be a massively ironic reason, people do not have time to take care or even admire the beauty of the world, their born place.  <br> <br>


                    I say, time's up, this is it. Let's stop it right here. Let's begin our journey right from The Ron Writes, and let's make a significant change. Let us know ourselves better, and let us be humble, find our purpose and find the purpose why this massive world even exists.
