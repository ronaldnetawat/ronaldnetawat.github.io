                <h2>Alpha & Omega</h2>
                <hr> <br>
                <p>'Sic mundus creatus est'. And thus the world was created. The life as we know it, the world as we see it, and the universe as we believe it, all came out of mere nothingness, and are stretching forward into eternal nothingness. The civilisation today is broke, it is unsettled, and imbalanced. In the hopes and expectations of presenting an affluent individuality in this society, people are going broke. There is an array of flaws in the humans of this era, be it from partying all night long, to sniffing drugs and cigarettes, in order to prove their masculinity. <br> <br>




                    Nevertheless, in the colossal story of the human species, we have already entered the Chapter which would lead our world towards complete obliteration. The 14th century Italian poet, Dante Alighieri describes the same in his legendary poem 'The Divine Comedy'. Kali Yug, as we know it in Hinduism, the Judgement day in Christianity, and the Al-Qiamah in Islam, all lead to one and the same school of thought, that our world in entirety, has set it's foot on the road to ultimate devastation.<br> <br>
                    
                    There is something extremely wrong dwelling inside of us, and this something, is our very inability to comprehend the disguised fact, that our world, our mother nature is at stake, and is dying every passing second.<br> <br>
                    
                    Stop wasting time on partying days and days, stop wasting time on flaunting money on worthless entities, and even reading the books of today, which mostly are impractical, and are merely nothing but bunches of papers, blabbering complexities which we do not even need in our life. Don't call someone foolish if they read old books, I too read old books, because I would rather learn from those people who built civilisations, than from those who tore them apart. Don't call people reserved if they don't talk much, because being alone is the way, and that is how ideas are born. Loners are the people who run this world.<br> <br>
                    
                    Stop wasting life, for you are not obliged enough to get another one. The universe was made with love, harmony, and kindness, and in love, harmony, and kindness must it end.
                    <br> <br>
                    The time is up, the countdown has begun, and the hourglass has been inverted. Does the last grain of sand in this hourglass of aftermath bring peace or complete obliteration, depends solely, and only, upon us
