                <p>Who are we? Why are we? These are the two unanswered questions of paramount importance of our civilisation. Did you ever think about it? Well, great if you did, but if you didn't, let's see. <br> <br>


                    For about an unfathomably long time, there was nothing, no mass, no space, and not even time, absurdity on another level right? How can we even imagine an absolute nothingness? Well, this is universe, everything that you can never imagine happens here. And then, after an incalculably long long time, happened the creation, which we now christened as The Big Bang. <br> <br>
                    
                    
                    This explosion, was the great creator. The creator and destroyer of worlds. Everything that we see around, every animal, every man, woman, thing, was at the very first forged into a tiny little point, smaller than the smallest of things. Unimaginable right? Everything came out of mere nothingness! <br> <br>
